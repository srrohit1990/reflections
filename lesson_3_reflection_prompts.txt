When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    This is useful to share the work with multiple people and collaborate.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    We can choose the version that you want to pull for more control.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is to make a copy of repository in github.
    Clone is to make a copy from github to local pc or local PC to local PC.
    Branch is to seperate the development work from the production work.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    This will help track the conflicts when we pull in a scenario where changes were simultaneous done both locally and on remote.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    It would be impossible to collaborate without github/git.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
