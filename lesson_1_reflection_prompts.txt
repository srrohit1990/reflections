How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    GC/diff easily helps find the difference

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    saving different versions of code on every change

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pro  : With Git we have more control on what/when we want to save.
	Cons : Extra Process

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Commit is like a savepoint. Easly to restore.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    diff <old file> <new file>

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    As it is easy to revert and we know we have a previous saved checkpoint.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To create local branches, pull/push code from PC.
